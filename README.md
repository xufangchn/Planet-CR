# Planet-CR: A Multi-Modal and Multi-Resolution Dataset for Cloud Removal in High Resolution Optical Remote Sensing Imagery

Planet-CR is the first public dataset for cloud removal to feature globally sampled high resolution optical observations, in combination with paired radar measurements as well as pixel-level land cover annotations. With this dataset, we consider the problem of cloud removal in high resolution optical remote sensing imagery by integrating multi-modal and multi-resolution information. We benchmark and in-depth analysis of representative cloud removal methods, highlighting the challenges and future research directions for high resolution remote sensing imagery cloud removal.

The major characteristics of this dataset are summarized as follows:

- **High Spatial Resolution**.  PlanetScope data has a spatial resolution of 3m. Compared to Landsat-8 data with 30m resolution and Sentinel-2 data with 10m resolution, it provides the opportunity to push the frontier of current cloud removal models on recovering clear edge and rich texture detail of high resolution remote sensing imagery.

- **Short Time Lag for Data Collection**. PlanetScope constellation satellites achieve nearly daily coverage of Earthâ€™s landmass, while the revisit time of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 is about 5 days and 16 days. Thus, our dataset allows to acquire paired cloudy and cloud-free images with a very short temporal offset, minimizing surface changes that may appear between the acquisitions of cloudy and cloud-free images. 
- **Multi-Modal and Multi-Resolution Fusion**. The inclusion of Sentinel-1 SAR data can provide auxiliary information to promote cloud removal of PlanetScope data. Compared with the existing cloud removal datasets like SEN12MS-CR, which mostly explore the fusion of Sentinel-1 SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data with the same resolution of 10m, our Planet-CR dataset helps to understand a more practical yet more complex problem, i.e., multi-modal and multi-resolution data fusion based cloud removal.
- **Information on Land Cover**. Due to the lack of information on land cover in the existing datasets, the performance of cloud removal methods over different land cover types is not clear. To disentangle the performance over different land cover types, we provide freely accessible land cover product from the WorldCover project. Moreover, it offers the chance of validating the effectiveness of the cloud removal methods on a downstream semantic segmentation task.

#### **The dataset, codes and models will be released soon.**
